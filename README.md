*Project Name: Hand Gesture Recognition Software*

## Overview
This project aims to develop a Hand Gesture Recognition Software using Python, Mediapipe, and OpenCV. The software detects and tracks hand movements and identifies 21 3D landmarks in real-time, enabling seamless gesture recognition through a webcam. The primary objective is to assist deaf individuals who face challenges with sign language communication. This README provides an overview of the project's functionalities, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Features
- Real-time hand and finger tracking using Mediapipe and OpenCV.
- Accurate identification of 21 3D landmarks for precise gesture recognition.
- User-friendly interface for effortless interaction.
- TensorFlow and NumPy integration for advanced capabilities.
- Mobile device compatibility for versatility and scalability.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-gesture-recognition.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Run the application: `python main.py`
2. Use the webcam to demonstrate hand gestures.
3. The software will detect and display recognized gestures in real-time.
